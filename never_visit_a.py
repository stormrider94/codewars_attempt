def subtract_sum(number):
    # say 3-digit number is N
    # say sum of digits is s 
    # N = 100a + 10b + c
    # s = a + b + c 
    # N-s = (100a + 10b + c) - (a + b + c) = (100a - a) + (10b - b) + c  = 99a + 9b = 9(11a + b)
    # meaning no matter what you do the answer you get will be a multiple of 9 since a and b can be any number
    # and 9 corressponds to apple 
    # all the multiples of 9 are apple in the list the guy gave
    return "apple"
